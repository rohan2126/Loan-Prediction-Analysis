# Loan Eligibility Prediction

Dream Housing Finance Company provides home loans across urban, semi-urban, and rural areas. The company aims to automate the loan eligibility process based on customer details provided in online application forms. This project builds a machine learning model to predict loan approval, helping the company identify eligible customers more efficiently.

## Problem Statement

This is a **supervised classification problem** where the goal is to predict whether a loan will be approved (`Loan_Status`) based on applicant data such as income, education, marital status, credit history, and more.
